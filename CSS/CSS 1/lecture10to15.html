    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>In April 1990, Universal Pictures bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen,[39] with Stuart
        Gordon to direct a low-budget film based on the property.[15] By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired
        the rights from Universal.[40] In January 1997, Nicolas Cage expressed interest in portraying the character,[41]
        while in September 1998, Tom Cruise expressed interest in producing as well as starring in an Iron Man film.[42]
        Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay.
        It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured MODOK as the villain.</p>
   
    <h3>Pre-production</h3>
    <p>
        Jon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006,[58] and he celebrated getting the job by going on a
        diet, resulting in him losing 70 pounds (32 kg).[15] Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer Avi Arad on
        another film after they both worked on Daredevil (2003).[12] The director found the opportunity to create a
        politically ambitious "ultimate spy movie" in Iron Man, citing inspiration from Tom Clancy, James Bond, and
        RoboCop (1987),[59] and compared his approach to an independent film—"[i]f Robert Altman had directed
        Superman"—and Batman Begins (2005).</p>
    
    <h2>Cast</h2>
     <hr />
    <p>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:
        An industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for
        the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part[9]
        and that the actor could not only make Stark a "likable asshole," but also portray an authentic emotional
        journey, once he had won over the audience.[10] Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance
        in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and
        dialogue in Iron Man.[11] Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater
        involvement in the screenwriting process,[12] especially when it came to adding humor to the film.</p>
